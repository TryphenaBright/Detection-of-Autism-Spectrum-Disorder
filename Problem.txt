Until 2001 there where Zero cases in ASD in India, it doesn’t mean that India is ASD free, it doesn’t aware of Autism. The government only recognized the disorder in 2001. According to a 2021 study published in Indian Journal of paediatrics, the estimated prevalence of Autism in India is around 1 in 68 children. Boys are more commonly affected and the ratio to Boys and girl is of approximately 3:1.
According to a report by ETHealthWorld, about million people in india are diagnosed with autism about 1 to 1.5 percent children aged two to nine years are diagnosed with ASD. Early diagnosis and intervention is still inadequate because the parents lack the necessary knowledge and information. And it is also stated that Indian parents hesitate to talk about such things to the doctor and this was the reason for the lacking in therapies. Early detection is the key to enabling children with ASD to lead a productive life.
A method for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using deep learning and eye movement tracking is proposed in the study "Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder Through Eye Movement Tracking Using Deep Learning“. The above may need doctor consultations which again put parents in distress.
Existing system help a medical practitioner to diagnose more precisely but we would like to take it to the parents since 1 to 1.5% of the total ASD in India does not arched due to lack of awareness and fear among parents. This also resulted in many unknown cases of ASD in India.
The main motive of the project is to help parents to identify ASD in initial stage so that therapies could be overarched in the early life of Children which could help them to develop into an individual who could take up their day to day activities without any support.
