The working of the Project
•	Support Vector Machine, a well-known supervised learning algorithm, is used to train the model because it uses a hyperplane to separate positive and negative input.
•	STEP1: To standardize the data, import StandardScaler from sklearn. preprocessing  in python.
•	STEP2: To test and train the data, import train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection  in python.
•	STEP3: To import SVM from sklearn  in python.
•	STEP4: To calculate the accuracy of the data, import accuracy_score from sklearn. metrics in python.
•	The dataset is obtained from Kaggle which is used in training the model.

Steps:
1.	Read the Dataset
2.	Standardize the data
3.	Test, Train and split the Data
4.	Classification by SVM
5.	Calculating the Accuracy.
