Libraries Used:
1.	Numpy: To hold Arrays.
2.	Pandas: To work with Datasets.
3.	Streamlit: Python Framework to create user interface.
4.	Pickle- It issue to convert python objects into byte stream to store it in a file or database, Transport data over network.
5.	Sklearn: to learn the transformations applied to the data before feeding it to the algorithm.

Database used: SQL Lite

Total Number of Data:1985

Functions used:
StandardScaler(): It is a function used to standardize the data values into a standard format. To make it standard mean must be 0 and Standard deviation is 1.
Standardization has two things to do with,
Normalization: Each and every feature contribute equally to the model training process.
Robustness: It makes the algorithm work without biased. Make the algorithm more robust and accurate in identifying anomalies (abnormalities) across different datasets.
Sklearn.model Selection: Used to split our data into train and test sets where feature variables are given as input in the method Train_Test Split.
SVM: Segregates data using Decision boundary aka hyperplane.
Sklearn.metrics:  measures the model’s performance.
Sklearn.metrics import accuracy store- assigns subset accuracy.
